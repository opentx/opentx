## getValue(source)



Returns the value of a source.

The list of fixed sources:

| OpenTX Version | Radio |
|----------------|-------|
| 2.0 | [all](http://downloads-20.open-tx.org/firmware/lua_fields.txt) |
| 2.1 | [X9D and X9D+](http://downloads-21.open-tx.org/firmware/lua_fields_taranis.txt), [X9E](http://downloads-21.open-tx.org/firmware/lua_fields_taranis_x9e.txt) |
| 2.2 | [X9D and X9D+](http://downloads.open-tx.org/2.2/firmware/lua_fields_x9d.txt), [X9E](http://downloads.open-tx.org/2.2/firmware/lua_fields_x9e.txt), [Horus](http://downloads.open-tx.org/2.2/firmware/lua_fields_x12s.txt) |


In OpenTX 2.1.x the telemetry sources no longer have a predefined name.
To get a telemetry value simply use it's sensor name. For example:
 * Altitude sensor has a name "Alt"
 * to get the current altitude use the source "Alt"
 * to get the minimum altitude use the source "Alt-", to get the maximum use "Alt+"

@status current Introduced in 2.0.0, changed in 2.1.0, `Cels+` and
`Cels-` added in 2.1.9


#### Parameters

* `source`  can be an identifier (number) (which was obtained by the getFieldInfo())
or a name (string) of the source.



#### Return value

* `value` current source value (number). Zero is returned for:
 * non-existing sources
 * for all telemetry source when the telemetry stream is not received
 * far all non allowed sensors while FAI MODE is active

* `table` GPS position is returned in a table:
 * `lat` (number) latitude, positive is North
 * `lon` (number) longitude, positive is East
 * `pilot-lat` (number) pilot latitude, positive is North
 * `pilot-lon` (number) pilot longitude, positive is East

* `table` GPS date/time, see getDateTime()

* `table` Cells are returned in a table
(except where no cells were detected in which
case the returned value is 0):
 * table has one item for each detected cell:
  * key (number) cell number (1 to number of cells)
  * value (number) current cell voltage



##### Notice
Getting a value by its numerical identifier is faster then by its name.
While `Cels` sensor returns current values of all cells in a table, a `Cels+` or
`Cels-` will return a single value - the maximum or minimum Cels value.
