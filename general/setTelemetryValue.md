## setTelemetryValue(id, subID, instance, value [, unit [, precision [, name]]])



@status current Introduced in 2.2.0


#### Parameters

* `id` Id of the sensor, valid range is from 0 to 0xFFFF

* `subID` subID of the sensor, usually 0, valid range is from 0 to 7

* `instance` instance of the sensor (SensorID), valid range is from 0 to 0xFF

* `value` fed to the sensor

* `unit` unit of the sensor [Full list](../appendix/units.html)

* `precision` the precision of the sensor
 * `0 or not present` no decimal precision.
 * `!= 0` value is divided by 10^precision, e.g. value=1000, prec=2 => 10.00.

* `name` (string) Name of the sensor if it does not yet exist (4 chars).
 * `not present` Name defaults to the Id.
 * `present` Sensor takes name of the argument. Argument must have name surrounded by quotes: e.g., "Name"



#### Return value

* `true,` if the sensor was just added. In this case the value is ignored (subsequent call will set the value)



##### Notice
All three parameters `id`, `subID` and `instance` can't be zero at the same time. At least one of them
must be different from zero.
