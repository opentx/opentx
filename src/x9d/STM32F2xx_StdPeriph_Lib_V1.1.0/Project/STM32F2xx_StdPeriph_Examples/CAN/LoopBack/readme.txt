@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 125 Kbps. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbps. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.

User can select CAN1 or CAN2 cell using the defines in main.h :
@code
#define USE_CAN1
/* #define USE_CAN2*/ 
@endcode

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a> 


@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins

 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
