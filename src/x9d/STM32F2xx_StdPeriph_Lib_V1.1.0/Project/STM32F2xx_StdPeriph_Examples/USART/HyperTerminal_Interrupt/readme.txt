@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM1 Transmit and Receive 
interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.


First, the EVAL_COM1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.
The string that you have entered is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive
buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as maximum (the reception is stopped when this
maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
     
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 

      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
