@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate several signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the KEY push-button, DMA transfers the two selected 
waveforms to the DAC.
For each press on KEY button, 2 signals has been selected and can be monitored on  
the two DAC channels:
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1) and Sine waveForm (Channel 2).
    - Noise waveform (Channel 1) and Triangle waveform (Channel 2).


@par Directory contents 

  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f2xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f2xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f2xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a> 


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 	
     - Use KEY push-button connected to PG15.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) and PA5 (DAC Channel2) pins to an oscilloscope.
     - Make sure that JP31 is removed.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
