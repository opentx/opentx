@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG/SWD IOs as standard 
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence. 

Note that once the JTAG/SWD IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG/SWD IOs remain disabled. 
To avoid this situation, the Key push-button is used to disable or not the JTAG/SWD IOs:
 1. Key push-button maintained pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs disabled and LED1 turned ON
 2. Key push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs unchanged and LED2 turned ON

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your JTAG/SWD probe and run 
the example in stand-alone mode.

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PG.06 and PG.08
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
