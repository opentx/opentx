@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to 
convert a regular channel in Triple interleaved mode using DMA in mode 2 with 
6Msps .

The Triple interleaved delay is configured 5 ADC clk cycles.

In Triple ADC mode, three DMA requests are generated: 
- On the first request, both ADC2 and ADC1 data are transferred (ADC2 data take 
  the upper half-word and ADC1 data take the lower half-word). 
- On the second request, both ADC1 and ADC3 data are transferred (ADC1 data take
  the upper half-word and ADC3 data take the lower half-word).
- On the third request, both ADC3 and ADC2 data are transferred (ADC3 data take 
  the upper half-word and ADC2 data take the lower half-word) and so on.

On each DMA request (two data items are available) two half-words representing 
two ADC-converted data items are transferred as a word.

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available :
1st request: ADC_CDR[31:0] = (ADC2_DR[15:0] << 16) | ADC1_DR[15:0] (step1)
2nd request: ADC_CDR[31:0] = (ADC1_DR[15:0] << 16) | ADC3_DR[15:0] (step2)
3rd request: ADC_CDR[31:0] = (ADC3_DR[15:0] << 16) | ADC2_DR[15:0] (step3)
4th request: ADC_CDR[31:0] = (ADC2_DR[15:0] << 16) | ADC1_DR[15:0] (step1) and so on.

The conversion is triggered by software.

The ADC1, ADC2 and ADC3 are configured to convert ADC Channel 12.
By this way, the ADC can reach 6Msps, in fact the same channel is converted
each 5 cycles

In this example, the system clock is 120MHz, APB2 = 60MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2. 
Since ADCCLK= 30MHz and Conversion rate = 5 cycles 
==> Conversion Time = 30M/5cyc = 6Msps

@note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply GND
      to the EVAL board GND)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
