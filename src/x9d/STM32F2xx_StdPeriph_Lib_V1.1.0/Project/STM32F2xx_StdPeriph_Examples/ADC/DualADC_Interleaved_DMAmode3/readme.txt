@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to
convert a regular channel in Dual interleaved mode using DMA in mode 3 with 5Msps.

DMA mode 3 is used in interleaved mode in 6-bit and 8-bit resolutions.

The Dual interleaved delay is configured 6 ADC clk cycles.

On each DMA request (two data items are available) two bytes representing two 
ADC-converted data items are transferred as a half word.
The data transfer order is similar to that of the DMA mode 2.

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available
1st request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0] 
2nd request: ADC_CDR[15:0] = (ADC2_DR[7:0] << 8) | ADC1_DR[7:0]

The ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert ADC Channel 12, with conversion 
triggered by software.
By this way, ADC channel 12 is converted each 6 cycles.

In this example, the system clock is 120MHz, APB2 =60MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2.
Since ADCCLK= 30MHz and Conversion rate = 6 cycle
==> Conversion Time = 30M/6cyc = 5Msps.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the power supply 
      GND to the EVAL board GND)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
