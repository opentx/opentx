@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three 
complementary TIM1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
feature and to lock the desired parameters.

TIM1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock used is SystemCoreClock (120MHz).

The objective is to generate PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1

The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

A dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock is inserted between the different 
complementary signals, and the Lock level 1 is selected.
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls"

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.
    
  - STM322xG Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PE.11)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)  
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)

    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
