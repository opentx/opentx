@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different delays.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM3 counter clock at 1 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz for STM32F2xx Devices RevA, RevZ and RevB.

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM3_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM3 counter clock  = 1000 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 1000 ms.

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 500:
TIM3_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 500 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 250:
TIM3_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 250 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 250 ms.

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 125:
TIM3_CH4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 125 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a signal with a delay equal to 125 ms.

The delay correspond to the time difference between PG.06 and  TIM3_CHx signal
rising edges.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - Use LED1 connected to PG.06
       - PC.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PC.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PC.08 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PC.09 (TIM3_CH4)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
