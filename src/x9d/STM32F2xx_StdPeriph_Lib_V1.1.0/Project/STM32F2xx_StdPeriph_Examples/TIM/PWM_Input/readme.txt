@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock/4 (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
counter clock is SystemCoreClock/2 (Hz).
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz fro STM32F2xx Devices RevA, RevZ and RevB.

TIM4 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM4 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle we use the TIM4 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM4_IRQHandler routine, the frequency and the duty cycle of the external 
signal are computed. 
The "Frequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM4 counter clock = SystemCoreClock / 2,
Frequency = TIM4 counter clock / TIM4_CCR2 in Hz, 
The "DutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:
DutyCycle = (TIM4_CCR1*100)/(TIM4_CCR2) in %.

The minimum frequency value to measure is 915 Hz (TIM4 counter clock / CCR MAX).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.   

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM4 CH2 pin (PB.07).
