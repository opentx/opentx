@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use DMA with TIM1 Update request
to transfer Data from memory to TIM1 Capture Compare Register3.

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz for STM32F2xx Devices RevA, RevZ and RevB.

The objective is to configure TIM1 channel 3 to generate complementary PWM
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz:
   - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
and a variable duty cycle that is changed by the DMA after a specific number of
Update DMA request.

The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM1 Repetion counter,
each 3 Update Requests, the TIM1 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
value defined by the SRC_Buffer.

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a> 
      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms: 
        - TIM1 CH3  (PA.10)
        - TIM1 CH3N (PB.15)  

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
