@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM3 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different frequencies.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and we want to get TIM3
counter clock at 15 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz for STM32F2xx devices

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 40961: 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 366.2 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 183.1 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR2 register is equal to 20480:
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 732.4 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 366.3 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR3 register is equal to 10240:
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 1464.8 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 732.4 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR4 register is equal to 5120:
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  2929.6 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1464.8 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.
        
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM3 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
       - PC.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PC.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PC.08 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PC.09 (TIM3_CH4) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
