@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 7 PWM signals 
with 4 different duty cycles (50%, 37.5%, 25% and 12.5%).

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz for STM32F2xx devices.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
The channel 1 and channel 1N duty cycle is set to 50%
The channel 2 and channel 2N duty cycle is set to 37.5%
The channel 3 and channel 3N duty cycle is set to 25%
The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5%
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.
    
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PE.11)
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)
      - TIM1_CH4  pin (PA.11)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
