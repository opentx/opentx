@par Example Description 
           
This example shows how to use the external SRAM mounted on STM322xG-EVAL RevB 
as program data memory (including heap and stack).
The example scenario doesn't reflect a real application case; its purpose is to
provide only the procedure to follow to use the external SRAM as data memory.

This example doesn't use the default library startup files, it uses startup files
provided within this folder.

@note This SRAM memory is not available on STM322xG-EVAL board RevA.


@par Directory contents

  - FSMC/SRAM_DataMemory/system_stm32f2xx.c          STM32F2xx system clock configuration file 
  - FSMC/SRAM_DataMemory/stm32f2xx_conf.h            Library Configuration file
  - FSMC/SRAM_DataMemory/stm32f2xx_it.c              Interrupt handlers
  - FSMC/SRAM_DataMemory/stm32f2xx_it.h              Header for stm32f2xx_it.c
  - FSMC/SRAM_DataMemory/main.c                      Main program

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

      
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

    @note The STM322xG-EVAL board RevA was wrongly named STM3220F-EVAL
    
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Update your project settings as follows:
<ul>
 <li> MDK-ARM 
    - in Project->Options for Target window, select 'RAM1'and enter 0x64000000 
      as start address with size of 0x100000 (IRAM1 must be un-checked)
    - uncomment "#define DATA_IN_ExtSRAM " in the "system_stm32f2xx.c" file               

 <li> EWARM 
    - use "stm32f2xx_flash_extsram.icf" as linker file (under Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template\EWARM)
    - uncomment "#define DATA_IN_ExtSRAM " in the "system_stm32f2xx.c" file

 <li> RIDE 
    - In the Application options -> script menu, set "Use Default Script File" 
      to "No" and use "stm32f2xx_flash_extsram.ld" as Script File.
    - uncomment "#define DATA_IN_ExtSRAM " in the "system_stm32f2xx.c" file

<li> TASKING 
    - In the project workspace window, open the stm32f2xx.lsl file.
    - From the memory window, select rom and enter and enter 0x64000000 
      as address with size of 1024k.
    - uncomment "#define DATA_IN_ExtSRAM " in the "system_stm32f2xx.c" file
  
 <li> TrueSTUDIO 
    - In the project properties window, select 'C/C++ Build'->settings node then 
      the 'C Linker'->General node and use "stm32f2xx_flash_extsram.ld" as Script File.
    - uncomment "#define DATA_IN_ExtSRAM " in the "system_stm32f2xx.c" file
      
</ul>
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
