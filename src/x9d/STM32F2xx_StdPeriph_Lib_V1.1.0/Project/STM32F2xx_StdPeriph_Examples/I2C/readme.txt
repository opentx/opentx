In Addition to the I2C examples provided within this repository, ST is providing
a Communication peripheral application library (CPAL) for all STM32 I2C peripherals.
CPAL provides a high layer API, drivers for each STM32 device, a project template
allowing users to build a new project from scratch, and some examples showing how
to use and customize the CPAL library.

For more details please refer to "Communication peripheral application library (CPAL) UM1029"
available for download on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>.
