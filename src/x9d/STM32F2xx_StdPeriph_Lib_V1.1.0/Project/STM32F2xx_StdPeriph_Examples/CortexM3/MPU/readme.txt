@par Example Description 

This example presents the MPU features on STM32F2xx devices and it can be easily
ported to any other STM32 device supporting MPU.

The example purpose is to configure a memory region as privileged read only region
and tries to perform read and write operation in different mode.

If the access is permitted LED1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted, 
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.
To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, uncomment
the following line "PrivilegedReadOnlyArray[0] = 'e';" in the "stm32_mpu.c" file.

      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>



@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain and setup your project configuration as follows
 - Add the required example files
   - stm32_mpu.c
<ul>
- For RIDE and TrueSTUDIO toolchains you have to follow these instructions

    <li> RIDE 
        - In the Application options -> script menu, set "Use Default Script File" 
          to "No" and use "stm32F_flash_ROAarray.ld" as Script File. 
          This linker is configured for STM32F2xx. It should be updated to use it
          with other STM32 devices.      
        

    <li> TrueSTUDIO 
          - In the project properties window, select C/C++ Build->settings node then 
           the C Linker->General node and use "stm32F_flash_ROAarray.ld" as Script File.
          This linker is configured for STM32F2xx. It should be updated to use it
          with other STM32 devices.         
</ul>    
 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
