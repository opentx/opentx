@par Example Description 

This example shows how to modify CortexM3 Thread mode privilege access and stack.
CortexM3 Thread mode is entered on Reset, and can be entered as a result of an
exception return.  

The associated program is used to:

1. Switch the Thread mode stack from Main stack to Process stack

2. Switch the Thread mode from Privileged to Unprivileged

3. Switch the Thread mode from Unprivileged back to Privileged

To monitor the stack used and the privileged or unprivileged access level of code
in Thread mode, a set of variables is available within the program. It is also
possible to use the 'Cortex register' window of the debugger.

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>

         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
