@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC): 

- Configuration of 2 EXTI Lines (WAKEUP button EXTI Line & KEY button EXTI Line)
  to generate an interrupt on each falling edge and use the SysTick interrupt.
- These interrupts are configured with the following parameters:
    - WAKEUP button EXTI Line:  
        - PreemptionPriority = PreemptionPriorityValue
        - SubPriority = 0
    - KEY button EXTI Line:    
        - PreemptionPriority = 0
        - SubPriority = 1           
    - SysTick Handler:  
        - PreemptionPriority = !PreemptionPriorityValue
        - SubPriority = 0             
First, the PreemptionPriorityValue is equal to 0, the WAKEUP button EXTI Line 
has higher preemption priority than the SysTick handler. 

In the KEY button EXTI Line interrupt routine the WAKEUP button EXTI Line and 
SysTick preemption priorities are inverted. 
In the WAKEUP button EXTI Line interrupt routine the pending bit of the SysTick 
interrupt is set this will cause SysTick ISR to preempt the WAKEUP button EXTI 
Line ISR only if it has higher preemption priority.

The system behaves as following:
 
1) The first time KEY button EXTI Line interrupt occurs the SysTick preemption 
become higher than WAKEUP button EXTI Line one. So when the WAKEUP button EXTI 
Line interrupt occurs, the SysTick ISR is executed and the PreemptionOccured 
variable become TRUE and the four leds (LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4) start toggling.

2) When the next KEY button EXTI Line interrupt occurs the SysTick preemption
become lower than WAKEUP button EXTI Line one. So when the WAKEUP button EXTI Line
interrupt occurs, the PreemptionOccured variable became FALSE and the four leds
(LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4) stop toggling.

Then this behavior is repeated from point 1) in an infinite loop.

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily 
    tailored to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use the WAKEUP push-button connected to pin PA.00 (EXTI Line0).
    - Use the KEY push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)

      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
