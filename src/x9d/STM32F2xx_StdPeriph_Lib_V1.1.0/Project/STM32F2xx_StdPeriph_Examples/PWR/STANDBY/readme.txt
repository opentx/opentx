@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enters the system to STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using: external RESET, RTC Alarm A or WKUP pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 120 MHz, an EXTI line
is configured to generate an interrupt on falling edge and the SysTick is programmed
to generate an interrupt each 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt handler, the LED1 is
toggled, this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in STANDBY or RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the EXTI line an interrupt is generated. In the 
EXTI handler routine the RTC is configured to generate an Alarm event in 5 second
then the system enters STANDBY mode causing the LED1 to stop toggling. 
A rising edge on WKUP pin or an external RESET will wake-up the system from
STANDBY. If within 5 second neither rising edge on WKUP pin nor external RESET
are generated, the RTC Alarm A will wake-up the system. 

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET, the RTC configuration (clock source, prescaler,...) is kept and LED1 restarts
toggling. As result there is no need to configure the RTC.

two leds LED1 and LED2 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED2 ON: RTC configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 off : system in STANDBY mode

These Steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode, please refer to 
      @subpage PWR_CurrentConsumption example.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode, this is due to the fact 
      that the Cortex™-M3 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disbaled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected to PG.06 and PG.08 pins
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG15 (EXTI Line15)
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
