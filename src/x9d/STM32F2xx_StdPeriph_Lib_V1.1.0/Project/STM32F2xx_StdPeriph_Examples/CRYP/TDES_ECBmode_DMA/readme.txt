@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using TDES Algorithm.

For this example, DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the CRYPTO processor
IN FIFO and also to transfer data from CRYPTO processor OUT FIFO to memory.

The data to be encrypted is a 320 bit data, which correspond to 5 TDES Blocks.

This example behaves as follow:
- TDES Encryption   (PlainData --> EncryptedData)
- TDES Decryption   (EncryptedData --> DecryptedData)

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC 
HyperTerminal using the USART (CN16).

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F21x Devices (Cryptographic acceleration not 
    embedded in STM32F20x Devices).

  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
